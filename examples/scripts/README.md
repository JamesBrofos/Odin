# Trading Scripts in Odin

These scripts demonstrate how Odin can interface with Interactive Brokers to place algorithmic trades. **If you did not properly configure Odin or if you use your live trading account, be aware that real trades will be executed.** If you decide to try these scripts, it is recommended that you do so by logging into your paper trading session of TWS.

Please be cautious when executing these demo scripts and please ensure that you know exactly what you are doing.
