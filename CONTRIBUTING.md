# Contributing to Odin

Odin is constantly being worked on and improved by its developers. We would be happy to receive pull requests if you have a feature or a bug fix that you want to see included in the main software. Feel free to open a pull request.

Please refer to Odin's issues page for a (partial) list of improvements and planned features that we are aiming on incorporating into Odin.

## Slack

Odin uses a Slack channel for chats between developers. The slack page can be found at [https://odin-global.slack.com/](https://odin-global.slack.com/). Please send james Brofos an email if you'd like to request to be added to the Slack channel.

## Requesting a Feature

If you have a feature in mind that you'd like to see incorporated into Odin, please open a Github issue to discuss the enhancement. Ideally, your issue should detail the desired syntax and demonstrate how the functionality integrates elegantly with the rest of Odin's codebase. 

After there is agreement that your enhancement is a good one, feel free to start writing an implementation in code. Be sure to write thorough tests for your new feature to ensure that it works as expected, even in border cases! You can put your test code in the `./odin/tests/` directory.

## Examples

We are always happy to see how you might have used Odin in your own backtesting or trading. :) Moreover, if you have an example that you'd like to add which illustrates how to implement a common strategy in Odin, please consider adding it to the `./examples/` directory.
